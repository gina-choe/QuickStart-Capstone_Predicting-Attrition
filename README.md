# Machine Learning Powered Employee Attrition Analysis

### Introduction

This is a case study involving human resources data to predict which employee may leave a company using Machine Learning algorithms. The dataset used in this study was was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/hr-analytics-case-study).

#### The Problem Statement from Kaggle

A large company named XYZ, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons

1. The former employeesâ€™ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners.
2. A sizable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent.
3. More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatize themselves to the company.

Hence, the management has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.

You are required to model the probability of attrition using a logistic regression. The results thus obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.

#### My Approach

I became interested in this dataset because HR analytics is becoming increasingly emphasized by successful workplaces. More companies are realizing that happy employees means increased productivity and growth, while employee attrition can be costly and obstructive. In my project, I aim to provide the logistic regression model requested by the management, but also to explore other models that may provide predictive power to understand which employees might leave the company. Prior to modeling, the data was cleaned and analyzed. This project was completed using R as the programming language.
